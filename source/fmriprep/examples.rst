Example Scripts
=============================

Example Single-Subject Job Script
---------------------------------
This example script was written to process a single subject ``P01`` from
BIDS-formatted dataset ``D01`` stored in ``$USER_DATA``.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    #!/bin/bash
    #
    #SBATCH --job-name=P01-fmriprep
    #SBATCH --output=$USER_DATA/D01/jobs/out/P01-fmriprep-out.txt
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
    #SBATCH --partition=medium
    #SBATCH --time=50:00:00
    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=5000
    #SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
    
    # Users should only need to change the dataset_dir and the participant below to run this script.
    
    # set the path to the dataset directory. This is the parent to the BIDS-formatted nifti directory.
    dataset_dir=$USER_DATA/D01
    
    # set the name of the participant
    participant=P01
    
    # load the module
    module load rc/fmriprep/20.2.3
    
    # run fmriprep
    fmriprep --work-dir $dataset_dir/workdir/ \
             --participant-label $participant \
             --output-spaces T1w \
             --fs-license-file $HOME/license.txt \
             --n-cpus 4 \
             --omp-nthreads 4 \
             --cifti-output 91k \
             $dataset_dir/nifti/ \
             $dataset_dir/nifti/derivatives \
             participant

- The job requests 4 CPUs and 4 GBs of memory per CPU for 50 hours total on the medium partition. 
- The working directory was placed directly underneath the dataset directory
- The output space of the BOLD images was set to native T1w space as opposed to a normalized template space.
- The copied FreeSurfer license file was placed in my home directory and referenced in the script.
- All outputs were requested to be in cifti-space (91k default)
- The bids_dir, output_dir, and analysis_level were listed in that order after the options.

This script can be submitted to the scheduler using ``sbatch <script.sh>`` where
script.sh is the full path of the script (or just the script name if the
terminal working directory contains the script).


Example Array Job Script
-----------------------------------

SLURM job arrays are scripts made to easily replicate a job to be performed
across multiple inputs (i.e. multiple participants) while not taxing the job
scheduler. Read more about SLURM job arrays at their `documentation
<https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_array.html>`__.

This example script was written to process all subjects from the
``participants.tsv`` file in BIDS-formatted dataset ``D01``.

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    #
    #SBATCH --job-name=fmriprep-%a
    #SBATCH --output=fmriprep-%A-%a.txt
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=5
    #SBATCH --partition=medium
    #SBATCH --time=50:00:00
    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G
    #SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
    
    # Users should only need to change the dataset_dir to run this script.

    # set the path to the dataset directory. This is the parent to the BIDS-formatted nifti directory.
    dataset_dir=$USER_DATA/D01

    # set the path to the BIDS-formatted nifti directory
    bidsdir=$dataset_dir/nifti/
    
    # set the participant id from the participants.tsv file in the bidsdir
    pid=$(awk "NR==$(($SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID+1)){print;exit}" $bidsdir/participants.tsv | cut -f 1)
    
    # load the module
    module load rc/fmriprep/20.2.3

    # run fmriprep
    fmriprep --work-dir $dataset_dir/workdir/ \
             --participant-label $pid \
             --output-spaces T1w \
             --fs-license-file $HOME/license.txt \
             --n-cpus 4 \
             --omp-nthreads 4 \
             --cifti-output 91k \
             $bidsdir \
             $bidsdir/derivatives \
             participant

This script will replicate the fmriprep command for participants in the
``participants.tsv`` file. When submitting this job, include the
``--array=<min>-<max>`` option in the ``sbatch`` command representing the index
of the participants you want to run. For example, if you want to run the first
10 participants in the file, use ``--array=1-10``, whereas if you want to run
the 7th and 10th participant only, use ``--array=7,10``. 

This script can be placed in and run from a ``code`` folder in the BIDS-sorted
``nifti`` folder to maintain BIDS compliance.
