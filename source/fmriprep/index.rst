fmriprep
========

fmriprep is an fMRI preprocessing pipeline designed to provide an easily
accessible interface regardless of scan acquisition parameters while requiring
little user input. It performs minimal preprocessing, steps generally accepted
to be necessary for any fMRI analysis pipeline. These include coregistration,
normalization, unwarping, noise component extraction, segmentation,
skullstripping etc. In order to run certain steps, it also performs automatic
surface reconstruction through `FreeSurfer
<https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_. fmriprep is similar in scope to other
minimal preprocessing pipelines like the `HCP Pipelines
<https://github.com/Washington-University/HCPpipelines>`_.

To perform preprocessing, fmriprep uses tools from a variety of well-known
software packages such as `FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/>`_,
`ANTs <https://stnava.github.io/ANTs/>`_, `AFNI <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/>`_,
and the aforementioned FreeSurfer. Which tools are chosen for which steps were
determined by the fmriprep creators. The tools used will be updated and changed
as newer and better software is available.
