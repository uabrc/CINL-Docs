Welcome to UAB CINL's documentation!
========================================

The 'Civitan International Neuroimaging Laboratory https://www.uab.edu/medicine/cinl/' provides a core resource at
UAB for state-of-the-art MRI neuroimaging experiments and analyses for examining
brain and body anatomy and function both in health and disease. 

This houses technical information for CINL mainly pertaining to data storage,
organization, pre-processing, and processing on UAB's computing cluster Cheaha.
Cheaha provides researchers with both data storage space as well as a large
amount of computational power necessary for high-throughput neuroimaging
analysis. Access to the Cheaha cluster is free for UAB researchers. Request an
account using the following `instructions <https://docs.uabgrid.uab.edu/wiki/Cheaha_GettingStarted>`_
