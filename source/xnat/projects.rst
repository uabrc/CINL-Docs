XNAT Projects
==============

There are several different methods that you can use to upload files to XNAT. In
order to make sure your files are properly organized and accessible to you and
others working on your project, it is important to first create an XNAT project
before uploading anything. 

.. note::
    All files uploaded to XNAT that you do not assign to a specific project will
    end up in the prearchive. The prearchive is accessible only to
    administrators, and so you will need an administrator's assistance to gain
    access to your files and to move them to the correct project.



Creating a New Project
----------------------

On the Home Page, click New >> Project from the dropdown menu to create a new
project. After selecting the Project Title and an abbreviated version of your
title for your Running Title, you will need to set a Project ID. Once set, this
Project ID can never be changed, and will be used by XNAT and other programs to
send files to your project and to reference your project for various other
purposes.

You can also write a description for your project, assign searchable tags to it,
or assign your project to a PI. None of these things are necessary, and all can
be added or changed at a later time.

User Roles and Permissions
--------------------------

XNAT defines 3 common project roles: Owners, Members, and Collaborators. Project
owners are able to add new users to a project and assign roles. Each different
role has different permissions for data access:

  | associated with your project. They can also add additional users to your project
  | and modify the data types associated with your project.
- | Project Members can manage the data in your project. They can read, insert,
  | and modify subjects and experiments in your project. They cannot modify the
  | project users and data types. 
- | Project Collaborators have read-only access on all of the data in your
  | project. They cannot insert or modify data owned by your project. They can
  | download your data and use it within their projects. 



Managing User Access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users can be added to your project and assigned roles using the Manage User
Access Dialogue
