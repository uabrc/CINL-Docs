About XNAT
--------------------

XNAT is an open-source imaging informatics platform developed at Washington
University with a deployment here at UAB. It facilitates both MRI data storage
in a common structure as well as sharing across labs both internal and external
to UAB. It is free to use for all researchers at UAB. More information can be
found at `xnat.org <www.xnat.org>`__.


Why Use XNAT
--------------------
- Can send data directly from the scanner to XNAT without copying to a flash drive
- Easy to add collaborators to projects and share data across labs
- Can act as a data backup
- Common storage system makes data preprocessing pipelines more generalizeable
