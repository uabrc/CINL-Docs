About BIDS
------------------------------

The BIDS data structure refers to a method of organizing and naming nifti and
associated JSON files for each MRI scan. Organizing data according to the BIDS
framework opens up access to various software applications that only act on BIDS
compliant datasets, such as fmriprep, mriqc, and qsiprep. Additionally, matching
structures across datasets makes navigation, exploration, and sharing of
datasets much easier. A short introduction to BIDS along with examples of BIDS
compliant file structures can be found in these docs. Read more about the BIDS
framework at `https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/
<https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.


Conversion from DICOM to BIDS
------------------------------

While writing custom code to convert from DICOM files to the BIDS framework is
possible, tools have been to make this more automatic and reproducible across
datasets. This documentation provides information and examples on one of those
resources, :doc:`HeuDiConv <bids/heudiconv.rst>`.
